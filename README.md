2. `fvm flutter doctor -v ` make sure all of the requirement are catered; Only add `fvm` if you are using fvm, `fvm` prefix is also applied to all flutter commands.

## Running the app

1. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to generate files
2. Make sure you have a device, iOS simulator, or Android emulator ready and connected. You can run `flutter devices` to check. Your IDE can show this information too.
